**Q: What is the black console window that appears when I start the aircraft?**

A: Don't close it. It helps the developers find bugs and fix them. If you close this window, X-Plane will crash. Along with the log.txt, this is one of the primary tools for investigating issues.

**Q: How do I start the aircraft?**

A: As of now, you can't start the plane from cold and dark because systems have not been implemented yet. For now, enable "Start with engines running" in the aircraft menu. When systems are implemented, you should follow the checklists and manuals found [here.](https://github.com/Stratosphere-Studios/777/tree/main/Documentation)
